# System-Monitoring

**1) To run the monitoring script run the following command:**

`bash ./monitoring.sh <T> <TP> <X> <Y>`

Where,

T: seconds granularity to record CPU load averages

TP: total seconds for the script to run

X: One minute CPU threshold (0-100%)

Y: Five minute CPU threshold (0-100%)

Eg: `bash ./monitoring.sh 2 20 30 25`

Here, the script records CPU load averages for every 2 seconds for 20 seconds. The one-minute threshold is 30% and five-minute threshold is 25%. These CPU percentages are applied to the entire system, hence they are mapped to a different range based on the number of CPU cores. Say, for 4 core: (0-100)% is mapped to (0-400)%. 

For the above example 30% is convereted to 120% and 25% to 100% thereby applying thresholds for the entire system. 

**Example results:**

To generate stress(on 2 cores with 100% utilization each for 200s):

`stress-ng -c 2 -l 100 -t 200`

Script output:

```
root@t11_vm8:~/System-Monitoring# bash ./monitoring.sh 2 20 30 25

4 CPU cores identified.
Applying X=120% [4 * 30] and Y=100% [4 * 25] thresholds on load average of all cores

Logging CPU usage..

HIGH CPU usage: 120% [1.20 - last 1 min average] recorded at 20:33:09

HIGH CPU usage: 120% [1.20 - last 1 min average] recorded at 20:33:11

HIGH CPU usage: 126% [1.26 - last 1 min average] recorded at 20:33:13

Very HIGH CPU usage: 100% [1.00 - last 5 min average] recorded at 20:33:13

The above script also checks whether there were any high/very high CPU usage, if not reports with appropriate message as shown below:

```
root@t11_vm8:~/System-Monitoring# bash ./monitoring.sh 2 20 30 25

4 CPU cores identified.
Applying X=120% [4 * 30] and Y=100% [4 * 25] thresholds on load average of all cores

Logging CPU usage..

No HIGH CPU usage seen since 20 seconds

No Very HIGH CPU usage seen since 20 seconds

**2) To run the Log cleaning script run the following command:**

`bash ./clean_logs.sh`

This script cleans the log files generated by the monitoring script every 1hr(end of hour).
